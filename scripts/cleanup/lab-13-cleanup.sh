This will permanently delete:
  - usms-transcript-pipeline-down (composite), and its two child alarms
  - ALL alarm history for them, which is not recoverable
  - the usms-overview dashboard
  - the usms-notify-count, usms-central-errors and usms-transcript-seconds metric filters
  - /usms/central/application AND EVERY LOG EVENT IN IT
  - the usms-transcripts-sampling X-Ray rule
  - USMSObservabilityWrite, after detaching it from two roles

A future alerting lab (not yet written) attaches SNS actions to those alarms by name.
Metric DATA already published into USMS/Application is not deleted by this
script and cannot be deleted at all - CloudWatch metrics expire, they are
never removed. That is worth knowing and is not a bug.
